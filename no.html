        <h1>For my love</h1>
        <p>
          Even if you say "no"... my heart didn't even install that option. 😄❤️
        </p>
        <p>
          My love for you doesn't come with an on/off button. It's lifetime
          validity, no cancellation policy, no return, no exchange - only
          unlimited updates and free hugs included.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can try to say "no"... but my heart already signed a permanent
          agreement with yours. Every beat of mine is chanting your name like
          it's my favorite song on repeat.
        </p>
        <p>
          I promise to love you in your happy moods, angry moods, sleepy moods,
          and even your "don't talk to me" moods. I'll love you during silly
          fights, late-night talks, and all the tiny moments in between.
        </p>
        <p>
          So please... don't make this poor heart wait too long. Say "yes" and
          officially accept this full-time, over-caring, slightly dramatic,
          forever-loving person.
        </p>
        <p>
          Come on... just say yes. My heart is already yours anyway. 💖😄
        </p>
